# Connect 42

Did you know there are 6x7 holes in a Connect Four board?
This is a P5 sketch of a Connect Four board with random moves being made which play notes, the column number determining the note in the scale and the row number determining the octave. When four or more in a row connect, we hear those notes as a chord again.
